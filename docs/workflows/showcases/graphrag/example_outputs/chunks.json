    "content": "When an intrusion is detected on a system, an organisation may wish to allow the intrusion to continue for a short period of time in order to fully understand the extent of the compromise and to assist with planning intrusion remediation activities. However, an organisation allowing an intrusion to continue in order to collect data or evidence should first establish with their legal advisors whether such activities would be breaching the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979.\nTo increase the likelihood of intrusion remediation activities successfully removing an adversary from their system, an organisation can take preventative measures to ensure the adversary has limited forewarning and awareness of planned intrusion remediation activities. Specifically, using an alternative system to plan and coordinate intrusion remediation activities will prevent alerting the adversary if they have already compromised email, messaging or collaboration services. In addition, conducting intrusion remediation activities in a coordinated manner during the same planned outage will prevent forewarning the adversary, thereby depriving them of sufficient time to establish alternative access points or persistence methods on the system.\nFollowing intrusion remediation activities, an organisation should determine whether the adversary has been successfully removed from the system, including whether or not they have since reacquired access. This can be achieved, in part, by capturing and analysing network traffic for at least seven days following remediation activities.\nControl: ISM-0137; Revision: 4; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nLegal advice is sought before allowing intrusion activity to continue on a system for the purpose of collecting further data or evidence.\nControl: ISM-1609; Revision: 2; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nSystem owners are consulted before allowing intrusion activity to continue on a system for the purpose of collecting further data or evidence.\nControl: ISM-1731; Revision: 0; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nPlanning and coordination of intrusion remediation activities are conducted on a separate system to that which has been compromised.\nControl: ISM-1732; Revision: 0; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nTo the extent possible, all intrusion remediation activities are conducted in a coordinated manner during the same planned outage.\nControl: ISM-1213; Revision: 2; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nFollowing intrusion remediation activities, full network traffic is captured for at least seven days and analysed to determine whether the adversary has been successfully removed from the system.",

In particular, an organisation should consider the security risks that may arise as systems, software and hardware are being designed, built, stored, delivered, installed, operated, maintained and decommissioned. This includes identifying and managing jurisdictional, governance, privacy and security risks associated with the use of suppliers, such as application developers, ICT equipment manufacturers, service providers and other organisations involved in distribution channels. For example, outsourced cloud services may be located offshore and subject to lawful and covert data collection without their customers\u2019 knowledge. Additionally, use of offshore services introduces jurisdictional risks as foreign countries\u2019 laws could change with little warning. Finally, foreign owned suppliers operating in Australia may be subject to a foreign government\u2019s lawful access to data belonging to their customers.\nIn managing cyber supply chain risks, it is important that an organisation preferences suppliers that have demonstrated a commitment to the security of their products and services \u2013 including throughout distribution channels.

Measures to monitor and manage security vulnerabilities in systems can also provide an organisation with a wealth of valuable information about their exposure to cyber threats, as well as assisting them to determine security risks associated with the operation of their systems. Undertaking continuous monitoring activities is important as cyber threats and the effectiveness of controls will change over time.\nThree types of continuous monitoring activities are vulnerability scans, vulnerability assessments and penetration tests. A vulnerability scan involves using software tools to conduct automated checks for known security vulnerabilities whereas a vulnerability assessment typically consists of a review of a system\u2019s architecture or an in-depth hands-on assessment. In each case, the goal is to identify as many security vulnerabilities as possible. A penetration test however is designed to exercise real-world scenarios in an attempt to achieve a specific goal, such as compromising critical system components or data. Regardless of the continuous monitoring activities chosen, they should be conducted by suitably skilled personnel independent of the system being assessed. Such personnel can be internal to an organisation or from a third party. This ensures that there is no conflict of interest, perceived or otherwise, and that the activities are undertaken in an objective manner.\nControl: ISM-1163; Revision: 9; Updated: Jun-23; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nSystems have a continuous monitoring plan that includes:",

    "content": "Business email compromise, a form of financial fraud, is when an adversary attempts to scam an organisation out of money or assets with the assistance of a compromised email account. An adversary will typically attempt to achieve this via invoice fraud, employee impersonation or company impersonation.\nWith invoice fraud, an adversary will compromise a vendor\u2019s email account and through it have access to legitimate invoices. The adversary will then edit contact and bank details on invoices and send them to customers with the compromised email account. Customers will then pay the invoices, thinking that they are paying the vendor, but instead be sending money to the adversary\u2019s bank account.\nWith employee impersonation, an adversary will compromise an organisation\u2019s email account and impersonate an employee via email. This is then used to commit financial fraud in a number of ways. One common method is to impersonate a person in a position of authority, such as a Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, and have a false invoice raised. Another method is to request a change to an employee\u2019s banking details. The funds from the false invoice or the employee\u2019s salary is then sent to the adversary\u2019s bank account.\nWith company impersonation, an adversary registers a domain with a name similar to another organisation. The adversary then impersonates that organisation in an email to a vendor and requests a quote for a quantity of expensive assets, such as laptops, and subsequently negotiates for the assets to be delivered to them prior to payment. The assets are then delivered to a location specified by the adversary, with the invoice being sent to the legitimate organisation who never ordered or received the assets.\nTo mitigate business email compromise, personnel should be educated to look for the following warning signs:\nIn dealing with such situations, personnel should have clear guidance to verify bank account details; think critically before actioning unusual payment requests; and have a process to report threatening demands for immediate action, pressure for secrecy, or requests to circumvent normal business processes and procedures.\nControl: ISM-1740; Revision: 0; Updated: Mar-22; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nPersonnel dealing with banking details and payment requests are advised of what business email compromise is, how to manage such situations and how to report it.",

Typically, emergencies would occur when access to systems cannot be gained via normal authentication processes, such as due to misconfigurations of authentication services, misconfigurations of security settings or due to a cyber security incident. In these situations, a break glass account (also known as an emergency access account) can be used to gain access. As break glass accounts generally have the highest level of privileges available for systems, extreme care should be taken to both protect them and to monitor for any signs of compromise or abuse.\nWhen break glass accounts are used, any administrative activities performed will not be directly attributable to an individual, and systems may not generate event logs. As such, additional controls need to be implemented in order to maintain the system\u2019s integrity. In doing so, an organisation should ensure that any administrative activities performed using a break glass account are identified and documented in support of change management processes and procedures. This includes documenting the individual using the break glass account, the reason for using the break glass account and any administrative activities performed using the break glass account.\nAs the custodian of each break glass account should be the only party who knows the account\u2019s credentials, credentials will need to be changed and tested by custodians after any authorised access by another party. Modern password managers that support automated credential changes and testing can assist in reducing the administrative overhead of such activities.\nFinally, break glass event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents. To facilitate such activities, break glass event logs should be captured and stored centrally.\nControl: ISM-1610; Revision: 0; Updated: Aug-20; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nA method of emergency access to systems is documented and tested at least once when initially implemented and each time fundamental information technology infrastructure changes occur.\nControl: ISM-1611; Revision: 0; Updated: Aug-20; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nBreak glass accounts are only used when normal authentication processes cannot be used.\nControl: ISM-1612; Revision: 0; Updated: Aug-20; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nBreak glass accounts are only used for specific authorised activities.\nControl: ISM-1614; Revision: 0; Updated: Aug-20; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nBreak glass account credentials are changed by the account custodian after they are accessed by any other party.\nControl: ISM-1615; Revision: 0; Updated: Aug-20; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nBreak glass accounts are tested after credentials are changed.\nControl: ISM-1613; Revision: 1; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nUse of break glass accounts is logged.\nControl: ISM-1715; Revision: 1; Updated: Dec-22; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nBreak glass event logs are stored centrally.",

Alternatively, if suitable write-once media is not used, the destination system should have a mechanism through which read-only access can be ensured, such as via a read-only device or hardware write-blocker. However, the use of read-only mechanisms is not immune to failure or compromise, therefore, rewritable media should still be sanitised following each data transfer.\nIt is important to note that for most non-volatile flash memory media, it will be possible to sanitise and reclassify it following a data transfer in order to allow it to be connected to other systems again. This is not possible for SECRET and TOP SECRET non-volatile flash memory media as it cannot be reclassified following sanitisation.\nControl: ISM-0347; Revision: 5; Updated: Apr-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nWhen transferring data manually between two systems belonging to different security domains, write-once media is used unless the destination system has a mechanism through which read-only access can be ensured.\nControl: ISM-0947; Revision: 6; Updated: Apr-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nWhen transferring data manually between two systems belonging to different security domains, rewritable media is sanitised after each data transfer.",

    "content": "Non-volatile magnetic media encompasses non-volatile magnetic hard drives, tape drives and floppy disks. While non-volatile magnetic tape drives and floppy disks can be sanitised by overwriting them at least once (or three times if pre-2001 or under 15 GB) in their entirety with a random pattern followed by a read back for verification, additional considerations apply to non-volatile magnetic hard drives due to their use of a host-protected area, device configuration overlay table and growth defects table.\nBoth the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table of non-volatile magnetic hard drives are normally not visible to a computer\u2019s Unified Extensible Firmware Interface or operating system. Therefore, any sanitisation of the readable sectors of non-volatile magnetic hard drives will leave any data contained in sectors listed in the host-protected area and device configuration overlay table untouched. Some sanitisation programs include the ability to reset non-volatile magnetic hard drives to their default state, thereby removing any host-protected areas or device configuration overlays. This allows the sanitisation program to see the entire contents of non-volatile magnetic hard drives during subsequent sanitisation processes.\nModern non-volatile magnetic hard drives automatically reallocate space for bad sectors at a hardware level. These bad sectors are maintained in what is known as the growth defects table or \u2018g-list\u2019. If data was stored in a sector that was subsequently added to the growth defects table, sanitising the non-volatile magnetic hard drive will not overwrite such data. While these sectors may be considered bad by non-volatile magnetic hard drives, quite often this is due to the sectors no longer meeting expected performance norms and not due to an inability to read or write to them. The Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) secure erase command was built into the firmware of post-2001 non-volatile magnetic hard drives and is able to access sectors that have been added to the growth defects table.\nModern non-volatile magnetic hard drives also contain a primary defects table or \u2018p-list\u2019. The primary defects table contains a list of bad sectors found during post-production processes. No data is ever stored in sectors listed in the primary defects table as they are marked as inaccessible before non-volatile magnetic hard drives are used for the first time.\nControl: ISM-0354; Revision: 6; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nNon-volatile magnetic media is sanitised by overwriting it at least once (or three times if pre-2001 or under 15 GB) in its entirety with a random pattern followed by a read back for verification.\nControl: ISM-1065; Revision: 3; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nThe host-protected area and device configuration overlay table are reset prior to the sanitisation of non-volatile magnetic hard drives.\nControl: ISM-1067; Revision: 4; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nThe ATA secure erase command is used, in addition to block overwriting software, to ensure the growth defects table of non-volatile magnetic hard drives is overwritten.",

When degaussing magnetic media, care needs to be taken as a degausser of insufficient magnetic field strength will not be effective. In addition, since 2006 perpendicular magnetic media has progressively replaced longitudinal magnetic media. As some older degaussers are only capable of destroying longitudinal magnetic media, care needs to be taken to ensure that a degausser with a suitable magnetic orientation is also used. Furthermore, to ensure that degaussers are being used in the correct manner to effectively destroy magnetic media, product-specific directions provided by degausser manufacturers should be followed. Finally, to provide an additional level of assurance following the use of a degausser, magnetic media should be physically damaged by deforming any internal platters.\nControl: ISM-0361; Revision: 4; Updated: Dec-21; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nMagnetic media is destroyed using a degausser with a suitable magnetic field strength and magnetic orientation.\nControl: ISM-0362; Revision: 4; Updated: Mar-22; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nProduct-specific directions provided by degausser manufacturers are followed.\nControl: ISM-1641; Revision: 2; Updated: Mar-22; Applicability: All; Essential Eight: N/A\nFollowing the use of a degausser, magnetic media is physically damaged by deforming any internal platters.",

This may include:\nNote, however, that if a memorised secret is written down, or stored in a document on a system, this becomes something that users have rather than something users know.\nPrivileged users, users of remote access solutions and users with access to important data repositories are more likely to be targeted by an adversary due to their access. For this reason, it is especially important that multi-factor authentication is used for these accounts. In addition, multi-factor authentication is vital to any administrative activities as it can limit the consequences of a compromise by preventing or slowing an adversary\u2019s ability to gain unrestricted access to assets. In this regard, multi-factor authentication can be implemented as part of jump server authentication where assets being administered do not support multi-factor authentication themselves.\nWhen implementing multi-factor authentication, several different authentication factors can be implemented. Unfortunately, some authentication factors, such as biometrics or codes sent via Short Message Service, Voice over Internet Protocol or email, are more susceptible to compromise than others. For this reason, authentication factors that involve something users have should be used with something users know. Alternatively, something users have that is unlocked by something users know or are (often known as passwordless multi-factor authentication) can be used. Furthermore, for increased security, the use of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication is recommended to protect against real-time phishing attacks.\nFinally, multi-factor authentication event logs can assist in monitoring the security posture of systems, detecting malicious behaviour and contributing to investigations following cyber security incidents.

Note, while single-factor authentication is no longer considered suitable for protecting sensitive or classified data, it may not be possible to implement multi-factor authentication on some systems. In such cases, an organisation will need to increase the time on average it takes an adversary to compromise a credential by continuing to increase its length over time.
