      Review this code against the test criteria.
      
      Test Criteria:
      {{tests}}
      
      Code to review:
      {{code}}
      
      Check each test case. Respond in this EXACT format:
      
      If ALL tests would pass:
      PASS: All test criteria met
      
      If ANY test would fail:
      FAIL: [specific issue found]
      Suggestion: [how to fix it]
      
      Be strict but fair. Only say PASS if code truly meets ALL criteria.
