# MCP Server: Anthropic Skills
# Auto-discovers and exposes all Anthropic skills as MCP tools

runas_type: mcp-skills
version: "1.0"

server_info:
  name: skills-engine
  version: 1.0.0
  description: "Auto-generated MCP server from Anthropic skills directory"

# Optional: Configure skills discovery
skills_config:
  # Explicitly specify skills directory (relative to config root, not this file)
  skills_directory: ../skills
  
  # Execution mode: "passive" (docs only), "active" (execute scripts), "auto" (detect Docker/Podman)
  execution_mode: auto
  
  # Optional: only expose these skills
  # include_skills:
  #   - python-best-practices
  #   - docx
  #   - frontend-design
  
  # Optional: exclude these skills
  # exclude_skills:
  #   - experimental-skill

# No tools array needed! Tools are auto-generated from skills at runtime.
# 
# How it works:
# 1. Server scans skills directory (default: config/skills/)
# 2. Reads SKILL.md frontmatter from each skill directory
# 3. Auto-generates MCP tool from name + description
# 4. Routes tool calls directly to SkillService
# 5. No template execution overhead
#
# Benefits:
# - Single source of truth (SKILL.md frontmatter)
# - Zero configuration - add skill directory, it's exposed
# - No duplication of metadata
# - Direct routing (no template chain)

# Add to Claude Desktop config:
# {
#   "mcpServers": {
#     "skills": {
#       "command": "/path/to/mcp-cli",
#       "args": ["serve", "/path/to/this/file.yaml"]
#     }
#   }
# }
